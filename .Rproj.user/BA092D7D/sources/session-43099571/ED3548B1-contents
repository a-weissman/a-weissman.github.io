# Anna Weissman {.center-title}

::: about-text
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My research agenda is broadly focused on representation in American Politics, with specific interests in local politics and descriptive representation. I am particularly interested in what shapes local governance in small-town and rural America.

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I received a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University. Subsequently, I spent three years as a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics.

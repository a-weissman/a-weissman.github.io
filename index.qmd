::: about-text
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Starting in Fall 2025, I will join the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.

My research explores representation in American Politics. I am particularly interested in who holds decision-making power and the implications for both policy outcomes and public attitudes towards representatives. One strand of my work focuses on local governance, with attention to understudied small-town and rural municipalities. Another branch of my research investigates attitudes about descriptive representation at the national level. My work is published in the *Journal of Politics* and the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics. I hold a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University.

Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener"
   style="text-decoration:none; color:#1e3a8a;"> Center for the Study of Democratic Politics </a> at Princeton University. In summer 2025, I received my PhD from the <a href="https://polisci.berkeley.edu/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener"
   style="text-decoration:none; color:#1e3a8a;"> Department of Political Science </a> at the University of California, Berkeley.

My research is broadly focused on representation, local political economy, and political geography. Specifically, I study who holds power in American local governments, how that drives decision-making, and whose interests are reflected in policy. I am especially interested in these dynamics in small-town and rural America. Another branch of my research explores attitudes about descriptive representation at the national level. Together, my work shows how place, identities, and institutions structure representation at multiple levels of government. I use descriptive and causal methods, including designs for causal inference with observational data, text analysis, and original surveys and survey experiments. My research is published in the *Journal of Politics*, *Political Behavior*, and the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT. I hold a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University.

# Anna Weissman {.center-title}

::: about-text
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My research explores representation in American Politics, considering both what shapes elected officials' decision-making and how constituents perceive their own representation. One strand of my work focuses on understanding conflict in local governance, with particular attention to small, exurban municipalities. Another branch of my work centers on descriptive representation at the national level. My research is either published or forthcoming in the *Journal of Politics* and the *Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy*.

Prior to Berkeley, I received a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University. Subsequently, I spent three years as a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics.

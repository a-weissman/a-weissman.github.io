I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in 2025.\nMy research is broadly focused on representation, local political economy, and political geography. Specifically, I study who holds power in local governments and how that drives policymaking. My current work centers on municipal officials’ embeddedness in their communities and the implications for policy outcomes, particularly relating to land use. I am especially interested in these dynamics in small-town and rural America. Another branch of my research investigates attitudes about descriptive representation at the national level. My work uses both descriptive and causal methods, including but not limited to causal inference designs for observational data, text analysis, web-scraping, and original surveys and survey experiments. My research is published in the Journal of Politics and the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy.\nPrior to graduate school, I was a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics. I hold a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University.\n\n\n\n\n\n Email  GitHub"

White voters’ support for politicians of color has long been linked to their racial attitudes, implying that this change could be a result of white Democrats’ increasing racial liberalism. This mechanism deserves more than speculation, since understanding the cause of this shift influences expectations about its likely durability and broader implications for racial politics. This paper provides evidence of the persistence of this shift and evaluates the most plausible potential mechanisms behind it. We find that racial attitudes are strongly associated with white Democrats’ greater approval of representatives of color at the individual level and over time, while there is little evidence that either ideological stereotyping or differences in legislator quality are responsible. These results provide evidence that white Democrats’ increasing racial liberalism influences consequential political opinions like support for representatives of color.\n\n“When Partisanship Matters in Local Politics”\n\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent scholarship challenges the traditional view that partisanship has little influence on local governance, showing that officials’ party affiliation affects municipal decision-making. However, the prevailing explanations for why partisanship matters often assume conditions present only in certain types of municipalities. I argue that partisanship matters more in larger cities, where the scope of governance creates the context for partisan division, while smaller municipalities focus on managerial concerns with limited partisan conflict. Using local council meeting transcripts, a novel dataset of candidate statements, and an original survey of 1,280 elected officials, I find that partisan divides emerge primarily in larger cities on nationally salient issues, whereas smaller municipalities show little evidence of partisan policymaking. These findings bridge perspectives from early work and recent scholarship by demonstrating that partisan influence in local governance is context-dependent. This research refines our understanding of when and why national political dynamics impact local governance.\n\n“Local Roots in Local Politics”\n\n\nAbstract\n\nHow do geographic ties structure democratic representation? While scholars have explored the role of legislators’ roots at higher levels of government, this question remains largely overlooked in municipal governance. Yet, local policymaking demands deep place-based knowledge. Using original datasets, including campaign statements, linked voter and candidate records, and nationwide surveys of local elites and the public, I show that local roots are central to understanding who runs for office, who serves, and the implications for local representation. Nearly all candidates highlight their local connections, and most have lived in their municipalities for decades. As a result, long-term residents are descriptively overrepresented. However, regardless of constituents’ own tenure, they view rootedness as a signal of credibility. Simultaneously, they perceive differences in long-term residents’ and newcomers’ policy preferences, meaning the prevalence of rooted candidates is both viewed as favorable and may lead to the marginalization of more transient constituents’ views. These findings reveal how a largely ignored dimension of local representation structures who governs, and by extension, whose interests are heard.\n\n“How Local Officials (Mis)perceive the Politics and Economics of Growth”, with David Broockman and Christopher Elmendorf\n“Measuring Place-Based Attachment and its Implications: Evidence from the Politics of Growth and Land Use”"

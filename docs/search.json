    "text": "Welcome!\nI am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the  Center for the Study of Democratic Politics  at Princeton University. In summer 2025, I received my PhD from the  Department of Political Science  at the University of California, Berkeley.\nMy research is broadly focused on representation, local political economy, and political geography. Specifically, I study who holds power in American local governments, how that drives decision-making, and whose interests are reflected in policy. My current work centers on municipal officials’ embeddedness in their communities and the implications for policy outcomes, particularly relating to land use. I am especially interested in these dynamics in small-town and rural America. Another branch of my research investigates attitudes about descriptive representation at the national level. Together, my research shows how place, identities, and institutions structure political power and representation at multiple levels of government.\nMy work uses both descriptive and causal methods, including but not limited to causal inference designs for observational data, text analysis, and original surveys and survey experiments. My research is published in the Journal of Politics and the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy and is forthcoming in Political Behavior.\nPrior to graduate school, I was a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics. I hold a B.A. in Political Science, Philosophy, and German from Tufts University.\n\n\n\n\n\n Email  GitHub"

Given local officials must navigate place-specific institutions and community needs, I theorize that deep local roots serve as a qualification for municipal candidates, with important consequences for who governs and whose interests are represented. Using a novel dataset of campaign statements, linked voter file and candidate records, and original nationwide surveys of elected officials and the public, I demonstrate that local roots pervasively shape municipal elections, which is reflected in who runs for office, how they present themselves to voters, whom voters prefer, and who ultimately wins. While officials tend to be rooted in their communities, I find that constituents are more mobile, making deeply rooted residents descriptively overrepresented, especially in cities with many newcomers. This translates into substantive underrepresentation for newcomers when long- and short-term residents diverge in their local policy preferences. I show that this divergence is likely, especially on land use issues. Together, these findings highlight a central, previously overlooked role for local roots in local politics and policy.\n\n“When Partisanship Matters in Local Politics”\n\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent scholarship challenges the traditional view that partisanship has little influence on local governance, showing that officials’ party affiliation affects municipal decision-making. However, the prevailing explanations for why partisanship matters often assume conditions present only in certain types of municipalities. I argue that partisanship matters more in larger cities, where the scope of governance creates the context for partisan division, while smaller municipalities focus on managerial concerns with limited partisan conflict. Using local council meeting transcripts, a novel dataset of candidate statements, and an original survey of 1,280 elected officials, I find that partisan divides emerge primarily in larger cities on nationally salient issues, whereas smaller municipalities show little evidence of partisan policymaking. These findings bridge perspectives from early work and recent scholarship by demonstrating that partisan influence in local governance is context-dependent. This research refines our understanding of when and why national political dynamics impact local governance.\n\n“How Local Officials (Mis)perceive the Politics and Economics of Growth”, with David Broockman and Christopher Elmendorf\n“Measuring Place-Based Attachment and its Implications: Evidence from the Politics of Growth and Land Use”\nBook Project: “How Place Conditions Local Politics: Understanding Local Power and Decision-Making Beyond Party Lines”"

Starting in Fall 2025, I will join the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.\nMy research explores representation in American Politics. I am particularly interested in who holds decision-making power and the implications for both policy outcomes and public attitudes towards representatives. One strand of my work focuses on local governance, with attention to understudied small-town and rural municipalities. Another branch of my research investigates attitudes about descriptive representation at the national level. My work is published in the Journal of Politics and the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy.\nPrior to graduate school, I was a research associate in the Political Science department at MIT, working with scholars in both American and Comparative politics.

White voters’ support for politicians of color has long been linked to their racial attitudes, implying that this change could be a result of white Democrats’ increasing racial liberalism. This mechanism deserves more than speculation, since understanding the cause of this shift influences expectations about its likely durability and broader implications for racial politics. This paper provides evidence of the persistence of this shift and evaluates the most plausible potential mechanisms behind it. We find that racial attitudes are strongly associated with white Democrats’ greater approval of representatives of color at the individual level and over time, while there is little evidence that either ideological stereotyping or differences in legislator quality are responsible. These results provide evidence that white Democrats’ increasing racial liberalism influences consequential political opinions like support for representatives of color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“When Partisanship Shapes Local Politics”\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing literature challenges the traditional view that partisanship has little influence on local governance, showing that officials’ party affiliation affects municipal decision-making. However, the prevailing explanations for why partisanship matters often assume conditions present only in certain types of municipalities. I argue that partisanship matters more in larger cities, where diverse electorates and more professionalized legislators create the context for partisan division, while smaller municipalities focus on managerial concerns with limited partisan conflict. Using local council meeting transcripts, a novel dataset of candidate statements, and an original survey of 1,280 elected officials, I find that partisan divides emerge primarily in larger cities on nationally salient issues, whereas smaller municipalities show little evidence of partisan policymaking. These findings bridge perspectives from early work and recent scholarship by demonstrating that partisan influence in local governance is context-dependent. This research refines our understanding of when and why national political dynamics shape local governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Local Roots in Local Politics”\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do geographic ties affect democratic representation? This question has been largely overlooked in municipal governance. Unlike much of the policymaking in state and national politics, local governance demands deep place-based knowledge. Using municipal council candidates’ campaign statements, voter registration records, and original nationwide surveys of both local officials and members of the public, I show that local roots strongly predict candidate emergence in municipal elections. Nearly all candidates highlight their local connections, and most have lived in their municipalities for decades before running. Rather than affecting who wins an election, local roots determine who enters races in the first place. This has broad implications for representation, as both officials and constituents perceive differences in long-term residents’ and newcomers’ policy preferences on core local issues. In high-turnover cities, this dynamic may systematically under-represent mobile populations. These findings reveal that national-level geographic polarization is accompanied by distinct dynamics in local governance across rural and urban America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“How Geographic Ties Shape Land Use Policy”\n\n\n\n\n\n(Work in progress)"

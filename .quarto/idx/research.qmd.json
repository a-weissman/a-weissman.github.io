Through the housing entitlement process, city officials may condition approval on the benefits developers provide to organized interests. But the politics and policies created by this discretionary review have yet to be studied through the lens of interest group mobilization. We bridge this gap with an analysis of the behavior of construction unions in the housing entitlement process. Using data from 164 U.S. cities, we find that construction union representatives are more likely to attend public meetings to advocate for favorable labor agreements when the expected profitability of new housing developments is high — and thus, when there are more particularistic benefits on the table. While interest group competition within local participatory institutions may signal a robust, pluralist democracy, it also risks driving up housing costs, to the detriment of both organized and unorganized residents.\n:::\n\n## Working Papers & Works in Progress\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## \"As Racial Attitudes Go, So Goes Approval: Why White Democrats Favor Representatives of Color\", with Anna Mikkelborg (invited to revise and resubmit)\n\nRecent research shows that white Democrats have become more approving of politicians of color compared to white politicians in the last decade, in contrast with past research indicating that white voters typically prefer white representatives. White voters’ support for politicians of color has long been linked to their racial attitudes, implying that this change could be a result of white Democrats’ increasing racial liberalism. This mechanism deserves more than speculation, since understanding the cause of this shift influences expectations about its likely durability and broader implications for racial politics. This paper provides evidence of the persistence of this shift and evaluates the most plausible potential mechanisms behind it. We find that racial attitudes are strongly associated with white Democrats’ greater approval of representatives of color at the individual level and over time, while there is little evidence that either partisan norms or ideological stereotyping are responsible. These results provide evidence that white Democrats put their racial liberalism into action by supporting representatives of color.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## \"When Partisanship Shapes Local Politics\"\n\nA growing literature challenges the long-standing claim of limited partisan influence in local politics, now providing evidence that officials' partisanship affects municipal governance. However, the reasons provided for why partisanship would matter apply variably across municipalities. Given the differences between large cities and small-town America, both institutional and demographic, I argue that officials' partisanship should matter less in smaller places. Using a multi-method approach, including analysis of council meeting transcripts, candidate statements, and a survey of 1,280 elected officials, I find that partisan division among representatives is largely absent in smaller localities and on many local issues. Partisan cleavages primarily emerge in larger cities on nationally salient topics. To assess why this might be the case, I investigate several mechanisms that contribute to a greater role for partisanship in large local governments. These findings bridge perspectives from early work and recent scholarship by demonstrating that partisan influence in local governance is context-dependent.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## \"Local Roots in Local Politics\"\n\nHow do geographic ties shape democratic representation? This question has been largely overlooked in municipal governance. Unlike much of the policymaking in state and national politics, local governance demands deep place-based knowledge. Using municipal council candidates' campaign statements, voter registration records, and original nationwide surveys of 1,280 local officials and 991 members of the public, I show that local roots strongly predict candidate emergence in municipal elections. Nearly all candidates highlight their local connections, and most have lived in their municipalities for decades before running. Rather than affecting who wins an election, local roots determine who enters races in the first place. This has broad implications for representation, as both officials and constituents perceive differences in long-term residents' and newcomers' policy preferences on core local issues. In high-turnover cities, this dynamic may systematically under-represent mobile populations. These findings reveal that national-level geographic polarization is accompanied by distinct local government dynamics across rural and urban America.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## \"How Geographic Ties Shape Land Use Policy\"\n\n(Work in progress)\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Peer-Reviewed Articles\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## \\[1\\] **\"Descriptive Representation in an Era of Polarization\"**, (forthcoming at the *Journal of Politics*). <https://doi.org/10.1086/732961>}\n\nStudies of descriptive representation find that voters more positively evaluate representatives who share their ascriptive characteristics.

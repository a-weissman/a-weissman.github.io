I argue that this pattern can be upended when voters develop more positive affect towards outgroups. In the United States, Democrats have increasingly expressed more positive views towards marginalized groups, while Republicans' attitudes about these groups have not shifted. Under such conditions, my argument predicts that the effect of representatives' race and gender on constituent evaluations should vary more by constituents' partisanship than by their own ascriptive characteristics. Applying a difference-in-differences design to 2008-2020 CCES data, I find that Democrats of all backgrounds now approve more highly of Congressmembers from historically marginalized groups, whereas Republicans' approval is unrelated to Member identity. Democrats also give women and minority representatives leeway to diverge ideologically. These findings demonstrate that polarizing attitudes about race and gender can disrupt classic patterns in how constituents evaluate representatives.\n:::\n\n\n\\[2\\] Michael Hankinson, Asya Magazinnik and Anna Weissman (2024), **\"When Do Local Interest Groups Participate in the Housing Entitlement Process?\"**, Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy: Vol. 5: No. 1, pp 47-69. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/113.00000093>\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Abstract\nLocal governments control a hidden flow of economic goods that never appear on city budgets. Through the housing entitlement process, city officials may condition approval on the benefits developers provide to organized interests. But the politics and policies created by this discretionary review have yet to be studied through the lens of interest group mobilization. We bridge this gap with an analysis of the behavior of construction unions in the housing entitlement process. Using data from 164 U.S. cities, we find that construction union representatives are more likely to attend public meetings to advocate for favorable labor agreements when the expected profitability of new housing developments is high — and thus, when there are more particularistic benefits on the table. While interest group competition within local participatory institutions may signal a robust, pluralist democracy, it also risks driving up housing costs, to the detriment of both organized and unorganized residents.\n:::\n\n\n## Working Papers\n\n**\"When Does Partisanship Shape Local Politics?\"**\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Abstract\nRecent scholarship challenges classic theories of non-partisan local politics, providing evidence of partisan influence in municipal governance, particularly in larger cities. To better understand this divergence from early literature, I investigate when partisanship shapes local governance across diverse municipality sizes. Using a multi-method approach, including analysis of council meeting transcripts, candidate statements, and a survey of 1,281 elected officials, I find that partisan divisions are largely absent in smaller localities and on many local issues. Partisan cleavages primarily emerge in larger cities on nationally salient topics. These findings bridge competing perspectives by demonstrating that partisan influence in local governance is context-dependent. This research underscores the continued relevance of non-partisan issues in local decision-making and highlights the importance of municipality size in understanding partisanship's role in local politics.\n:::\n\n**\"As Racial Attitudes Go, So Goes Approval: Why White Democrats Favor Representatives of Color\"**, with Anna Mikkelborg (under review)\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Abstract\nRecent research shows that white Democratic voters have become more approving of politicians of color compared to white politicians in the last ten years. This is surprising, since past research indicates that voters generally prefer representatives who share their own racial background. The mechanisms underpinning this shift are key to understanding its likely durability and its broader implications for racial politics. We evaluate three potential explanations: changing racial attitudes, partisan identity, and that race serves as a cue for politicians' ideologies. Our evidence suggests changing racial attitudes among white Democrats as the likely mechanism: racial attitudes are strongly associated with these voters' greater approval of representatives of color at the individual level and over time, while there is little evidence that partisan identity or perceptions of politicians' ideologies are responsible. These results provide evidence that white Democrats put their racially liberal attitudes into action through support for representatives of color.\n:::\n\n## Works in Progress\n\n**\"Local Roots in Local Politics\"**\n\n**\"Place-based Attachment and Attitudes about Land Use\"**\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Peer-Reviewed Articles\n\n\\[1\\] **\"Descriptive Representation in an Era of Polarization\"**, (forthcoming at the *Journal of Politics*). <https://doi.org/10.1086/732961>}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Abstract\nStudies of descriptive representation find that voters more positively evaluate representatives who share their ascriptive characteristics.
